message: I am writing to express my interest in the software tester position at your company. With a background in quality assurance and a focus on developing efficient testing frameworks, I am eager to contribute to your team's success. Currently, I am dedicated to building a comprehensive testing framework aimed at optimizing processes and ensuring software quality. Leveraging my expertise in automation testing tools and methodologies, I am focused on creating scalable solutions. As part of this effort, I have developed a base class facilitating efficient test automation. To provide insight into my work, I have attached a notepad with excerpts from the base class. This document includes most of the reusable methods for Selenium to perform testing. I am still actively working on it to add more features and functionalities. I believe this demonstrates my commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in my work. I am also excited to share a Selenium demo video showcasing my proficiency in automation testing. Please find the video attached. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further how my skills and experiences align with the needs of the company.
